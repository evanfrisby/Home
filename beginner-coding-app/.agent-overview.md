# Overview of the Beginner Coding App

## Project Goal
The primary goal of this web application is to provide a hands-on learning experience for beginners in coding. It is designed for users, particularly young learners, to edit, add to, and understand the fundamentals of web development through practical coding exercises.

## Learning Objectives
- **HTML Basics**: Understanding the structure of web pages using HTML.
- **CSS Fundamentals**: Learning how to style web pages and make them visually appealing.
- **JavaScript Introduction**: Gaining knowledge of how to make web pages interactive using JavaScript.
- **Component-Based Development**: Learning how to create reusable components (like a counter and a to-do list) to manage application state and behavior.

## Key Features
- **Counter Component**: A simple interactive counter that allows users to increment and decrement a number. This helps in understanding event handling and state management in JavaScript.
- **To-Do List Component**: A functional to-do list that enables users to add and remove tasks. This feature teaches users about arrays, DOM manipulation, and user input handling.

## Editing and Experimentation
Users are encouraged to:
- Modify existing code to see how changes affect the application.
- Add new features or components to enhance functionality.
- Experiment with different styles in the CSS file to understand design principles.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a foundational platform for learning coding concepts in a fun and engaging way. By interacting with the code and seeing immediate results, users can develop a deeper understanding of how web applications work.
